# CityLens

CityLens is an application designed to help users report urban issues by capturing images and generating automated reports using AI.

## Core Features:

- **Image Capture:** Enables users to capture images of urban issues or elements using their device's camera.
- **AI-Powered Image Description:** Leverages the Gemini API tool to create descriptions of the images.
- **Confirm/Edit Messages:** Allows users to confirm or edit the message before it is sent to the authorities.
- **Automated Report Generation:** Sends a report, which will include the image, a description of the detected issue and pre-written message to a predefined email address.
- **Basic Information Collection:** Design a simple form to capture a users email and comments on an issue. Keep all fields to a minimum and include descriptive error messages.

## Getting Started

For development, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

This project is built using NextJS and is intended to be used within Firebase Studio.
