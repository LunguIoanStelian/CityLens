## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calming blue (#4285F4) to convey trust and reliability.
- Secondary color: Implement a neutral gray (#E0E0E0) for backgrounds and less important elements.
- Accent: Green (#34A853) to highlight actionable items.
- Maintain consistent font sizes across all screens for readability.
- Use a set of clear and recognizable icons. Use filled icons for selected states and outline icons for unselected states.
- Follow a single-column layout to prevent overwhelming users. Place the most important actions at the bottom of the screen to avoid accidental taps.
- Subtle animations to confirm user actions such as submitting an image.
